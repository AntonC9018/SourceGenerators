# Source Generators

This is a collection of source generators I made while working at Flowqe.

The original repository can be found [here](https://dev.azure.com/flowqe-inc/Flowqe.Public/_git/Flowqe.SourceGenerators)

It's licensed under MIT.


## Notes

The polyfills and the msbuild configuration were mostly copied from [ComputeSharp](https://github.com/Sergio0694/ComputeSharp/tree/main) (thanks, Sergio!)


Run this command to refresh cached source generators:

```
dotnet build-server shutdown
```
